## CrowdLabelwithTextContent
The datasets of Crowd Labels with Text Contents of instances available. 

**We have just uploaded the QUIZ datasets, the documentations, source codes for data processing and the RTE dataset are under construction.**

Datasets used for our following papers: 

In this paper, the text contents are used by LLM to generate the labels. 

- Jiyi Li, "A Comparative Study on Annotation Quality of Crowdsourcing and LLM via Label Aggregation", Proceedings of the 2024 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing (ICASSP 2024), pp. 6525-6529, Apr. 2024.


In this paper, only crowd labels are used for proposing the label aggregation method.
